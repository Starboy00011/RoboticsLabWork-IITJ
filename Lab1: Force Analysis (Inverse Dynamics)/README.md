# Force Analysis (Inverse Dynamics) of 1-link robot

The lab1 was to built the basic understanding of the MATLAB , its function hwo to animate the robot in it, and basic know hows of it . In the Lab1 we worked Force analysis i.e. Inverse Dynamics of 1-link robot. We had to perform the following tasks:
a. Plot the commanded joint position, velocity and acceleration vs. time for time
period T = 3 s
b. Plot linear velocity and acceleration of the end-effector of the robot
c. Find joint torque (Ï„) required to follow the above trajectory and plot joint torque
vs time
d. Animate the system for the commanded trajectories.
